# Literature Review Summary: Assessment of Urban Fabric for Smart Cities

## Background/Motivation
Urbanization is accelerating at an unprecedented rate, particularly in rapidly developing nations such as China. With this growth comes a host of challenges, including urban sprawl, inefficient land use, loss of cultural identity, and increased pressure on infrastructure. The concept of urban fabric—the spatial and structural arrangement of buildings, roads, and public spaces—plays a crucial role in shaping the functionality, aesthetics, and sustainability of cities.
Historically, urban fabric has been analyzed through qualitative and theoretical frameworks, often relying on architectural observations and historical town planning theories. However, as cities transition into smart cities, there is a growing need for quantitative, data-driven methodologies to assess and manage urban development effectively. Smart cities leverage technology, data analytics, and computational models to optimize urban planning, improve quality of life, and promote sustainable growth.
The paper Assessment of Urban Fabric for Smart Cities by Xin Li et al. (2016) aims to fill a crucial gap in urban studies by introducing computational methods for assessing urban fabric characteristics. It builds on prior research by incorporating Geographic Information System (GIS) tools and statistical analysis to quantify key urban form indicators such as density, compactness, variation, fragmentation, and cohesion. These indicators provide insights into how different urban forms interact, evolve, and influence smart city development.
The motivation behind this study is to develop a systematic and scalable approach to understanding urban fabric that can be applied across different urban contexts. Traditional qualitative assessments of urban structure often fail to provide actionable insights for planners and policymakers. By introducing data-driven methods, this research offers a more objective and reproducible means of evaluating urban development patterns.
Moreover, the study's case focus—Hankou, China—illustrates the coexistence of historical and modern urban forms, a common challenge in many rapidly urbanizing regions. The authors argue that without careful assessment and planning, cities risk losing their historical integrity while failing to optimize modern urban efficiency. Their approach not only enables a deeper understanding of urban morphology but also provides practical insights for designing sustainable, adaptive urban environments that align with smart city principles.
## Methods Used
This repository provides computational methods for analyzing urban fabric, focusing on urban blocks, density, compactness, and spatial distribution using Geographic Information System (GIS) and statistical tools.

### 1. Geographic Information System (GIS)
- Mapping and analyzing spatial data.
- Visualizing urban block structures.

### 2. Quantitative Shape Indicators

#### - **Density**
  - Measures the proportion of built-up areas in an urban block.
  - Formula: 
    \[
    Density = \frac{\sum S_i}{S_B}
    \]
    where:
    - \(S_i\) is the footprint coverage of each building in a given urban block.
    - \(S_B\) is the total area of the block.

#### - **Compactness**
  - Evaluates spatial clustering of buildings.
  - Based on the gravity model to measure urban sprawl.
  - Formula:
    \[
    C = \frac{\sum \frac{1}{d(i,j)}}{N (N-1) / 2}
    \]
    where:
    - \(d(i,j)\) is the distance between raster cells.
    - \(N\) is the number of raster cells.

#### - **Variation**
  - Uses building footprint size differences to study rhythm and patterns.
  - Formula:
    \[
    Variation = \frac{\sum \sqrt{(S_i - S_{mean})^2}}{(N - 1) S_{mean}}
    \]
    where:
    - \(S_i\) is the footprint size of each building.
    - \(S_{mean}\) is the average building footprint size.
    - \(N\) is the number of buildings.

#### - **Fragmentation**
  - Measures the complexity of urban fabric using perimeter-area ratios.
  - Formula:
    \[
    Fragmentation = 1 - \frac{4 \sqrt{S_i}}{P}
    \]
    where:
    - \(S_i\) is the footprint coverage of each building within an urban block.
    - \(P\) is the perimeter of the tested patch composed of buildings.

#### - **Cohesion**
  - Analyzes how closely buildings cluster together.
  - Formula:
    \[
    Cohesion = |F - F'|
    \]
    where:
    - \(F\) is the fragmentation before shape aggregation.
    - \(F'\) is the fragmentation after shape aggregation.
